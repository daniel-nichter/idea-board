# idea-board
Idea Board is a minimalist app for writing down ideas. Instead of writing ideas on note cards and sticking them on my wall, I wanted to stick them on a web app. With [Meteor](https://www.mongodb.org/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/), and [jQuery UI](https://jqueryui.com/) this is pretty easy. For now, to run the app install Meteor then run `meteor run` inside the repo.
